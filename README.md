AI and ART:
Art is an intrinsicly human expression, thus the value of an Art-generation AI is
the same as a chess AI – it's a fun project, it's impressive, but the point of 
chess is to beat another guy at chess. Anything for its own sake is pointless. 
Humans have generally made things to make themselves safe and happy – fire, 
agriculture, some would say birth control. We are reaching a point where we are
progressing for progression's sake. The goal of greed is immeasurable disparity
in wealth, where all goes to one at the expense of all others. 
Acrylic is not like this though – you're using art and AI to lift others up. As an 
artist and engineer, I can think of a handful of nobler things to do in this
climate.

You asked for art – please enjoy my art: mediocre, but human!
